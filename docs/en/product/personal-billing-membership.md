        <strong>Two payment paths can now be described clearly in public: self-serve local script-slot expansion for the personal free edition, and the monthly or annual registration path that moves from the personal free edition into the formal standard-SaaS tenant entry.</strong>
        <p>This page answers four things: how the personal free page handles payment, how monthly or annual membership is registered, what users get after upgrading, and which parts are finished versus still unfinished.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="brand-lead">
        If you are still exploring individually, prioritize
        <strong>personal billing and script slots</strong>.
        If you are preparing to enter formal collaboration, prioritize the
        <strong>monthly or annual team-edition</strong>
        entry instead of keeping formal billing and formal usage inside the hidden personal-free tenant.

            <li>The personal free edition already supports self-serve order creation for local script slots, checkout-session creation, mock-payment success, and auto-activation after callback.</li>

            <li>The <code>public</code> super-admin side already supports order creation, payment confirmation, callback activation, renewal reminders, expiry shutdown, and recovery.</li>
            <li>The free path already exposes monthly and annual team-edition registration entries, while formal payment and formal tenant usage continue on the target tenant side.</li>

    <h2>What the free path, local script-slot expansion, monthly membership, and annual membership each give you</h2>

| Path | Best for | What you get | Current boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Personal free edition | Individual explorers and automation enthusiasts | Start from the public entry and the valid menu set in the personal free path, plus the CLI guide, to feel the value | Default script slots are limited and the space is not meant to be a formal team collaboration workspace |
| Local script-slot expansion | People already continuing to connect scripts in personal space | Expand local script slots inside the same personal space and get immediate quota write-back after payment | This is a one-time slot expansion, not a complete subscription center |
| Monthly team edition | Teams that want one month of formal collaboration validation first | Move into the formal standard-SaaS tenant entry and begin formal multi-user collaboration with a more stable tenant path | Final pricing and payment flow follow the target tenant page |
| Annual team edition | Teams already certain about long-term usage | Get a more stable formal tenant cycle and reduce repeated monthly renewal operations | It is still not the default path for private deployment; deeper boundary needs should be discussed directly |

    <h2>How the payment line should be described publicly today</h2>
    <ul class="brand-list">
      <li>It is accurate to say that local script-slot payment in the personal free edition has completed its smallest closed loop, and the <code>public</code> super-admin order lifecycle has also completed its smallest closed loop.</li>
      <li>It is accurate to say that the free path already exposes monthly and annual team-edition registration entries and clearly routes users into the formal standard-SaaS tenant entry.</li>
      <li>It is not accurate to say that the whole system already has a complete general self-service subscription center.</li>
      <li>It is not accurate to say that all payments are already connected to formal third-party gateways.</li>
      <li>It is not accurate to say that the free path has already closed the full registration, payment, activation, and renewal loop for formal team tenants internally.</li>
      <li>The more accurate public framing is this: <strong>the first version of the personal billing center plus the formal-tenant registration upgrade path already exists, while the complete general billing center is still being converged.</strong></li>
