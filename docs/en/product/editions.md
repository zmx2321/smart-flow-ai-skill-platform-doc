      <h1>Editions &amp; Roadmap</h1>
      <div class="brand-hero__panel">
        <span class="brand-pill">Version Plan</span>
        <strong>The public roadmap still speaks in <code>1.0</code>, <code>1.1</code>, and <code>2.0</code>, but the real usage path has already split into four layers: the free path, local script slots, the standard team edition, and enterprise delivery.</strong>
        <p>The version stages describe the platform build rhythm. The four layers describe which path a user should take. Those two things should not be mixed together.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="brand-lead">
        The current rhythm is better understood like this:
        <strong><code>1.0</code></strong> stabilizes real delivery, trusted execution, and local onboarding first,
        <strong><code>1.1</code></strong> fills in auto-registration, payment, renewal, and a lower-support loop,
        and
        <strong><code>2.0</code></strong> decides which paths are worth continuing as more standardized solutions.
        Multi-Skill orchestration is not a default capability today. It should enter formal productization only after the governance base is stronger.
      </p>
      <p class="brand-lead">
        <strong>The current core position of <code>1.0</code> is this: ExecFabric is a multi-tenant governance and execution platform that treats Python scripts as the first mature execution asset.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="brand-lead">
        Later <code>3.0</code> and <code>4.0</code> directions still exist in internal long-term planning, but the public roadmap only talks about <code>1.0</code>, <code>1.1</code>, and <code>2.0</code> so long-term ideas are not mistaken for current capability.
      </p>
      <p class="brand-lead">
        As of the current version, <code>1.0</code> has already completed its first compatibility-oriented upgrade:
        the general resource layer and executor registry layer have landed,
        and the first non-script capability sample is
        <code>HTTP capability access</code> in the <code>public</code> super-admin domain.
        The next priority is still not to spread horizontally into more capability types.
        It is to make <code>1.1</code> auto-registration, payment, renewal, and shutdown-recovery into a lower-support loop first.
      </p>
      <p class="brand-lead">
        This round also tightened the boundary further:
        <code>HTTP capability access</code> remains available only inside the <code>public</code> governance domain,
        whitelisted tenant admins keep only a minimal cross-tenant console,
        and the system no longer misidentifies administrators through unsafe conditions such as <code>user_id == 1</code>.
      </p>
      <p class="brand-lead">
        At the same time, the first real segment of <code>1.1</code> has already landed:
        the <code>public</code> order center supports order creation, payment confirmation, activation execution, renewal-reminder scans, and expiry-shutdown scans.
        The personal free edition also already has the first version of the billing center for local script slots, and the free path now includes explanations for monthly and annual registration into the team edition.
        A complete general subscription center, real third-party payment gateways, and outbound reminder channels are still not finished.
      </p>
      <p class="brand-lead">
        The shared-SaaS tenant frontend skeleton is also in place:
        starting from <code>tenant_1003+</code>, standard SaaS customers no longer default to cloning one frontend project per customer.
        They first go through the shared tenant frontend instead.
        It can already carry the formal tenant entry, but dynamic branding, initialization, and finer customization boundaries are still being tightened.
